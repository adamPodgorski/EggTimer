# EggTimer
EggTimerTest
Program created in Visual Studio/c# using Selenium
Aim of this project is to present ability to write automation tests using Selenium
Test is connecting with EggTimer application and is performing webdriver wait and waiting for next time (that is decreasing) each time the time changes. Here could also be assertion made after each tick.
But the test will stop and return message if the next tick will not be displayd.
One assertion made at the end of the test validaing if the time has ended and one assertion validating if all items are present on the main screen
